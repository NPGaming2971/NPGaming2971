### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a high school student that just *recently* got into coding. Exactly like 4 months ago.  
I love to learn new things. Programming world is just too large for me.  
  
I'm currently learning Javascript/Typescript and had some tiny experience with it. Looking forward to learn Java soon.  
  
You can view my dull stats if you want lol
